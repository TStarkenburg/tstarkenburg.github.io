                    <p>I study the formation and evolution of galaxies using both cosmological and zoom galaxy simulations. My aim is to connect physical processes in galaxy evolution to observational indicators. To do this I work on careful comparisons of observed and simulated galaxies, focussing on properties like structure, morphology, star formation history, and dynamics. I am also particularly interested in galaxies with uncommon properties, as these can provide key additional clues to the physics of galaxy formation. I work toward new methods to compare observational and simulated datasets in a more consistent quantitative way. </p>

                                <p>I am the Principal Investigator of the IQ (Isolated and Quiescent galaxies)-collaboratory, a ~30 astrophysicists strong collaboration started a the Flatiron Institute. The IQ-collaboratory endeavors to learn about galaxy quenching through careful, in depth comparisons of large simulated and observational galaxy samples. We aim to get as close to a one-to-one comparison as possible to be able to connect the different quenching methods to observational galaxy properties. Using mock galaxy spectra from a very large set of simulated galaxies we compare observational star forming, quiescent, and green valley definitions to empower the community and enable comparison between different observational datasets. </br>(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872..160H/abstract" target="_blank">Hahn, <b>Starkenburg</b> et al. 2019</a>, </br><b>Starkenburg</b> et al. in prep.; </br>Choi, <b>Starkenburg</b> et al. in prep.; </br>Dickey, <b>Starkenburg</b> et al. in prep.; </br>Emerick, Maller, <b>Starkenburg</b> et al. in prep.)</p>

								<h3 class="research-subtitle">Counterrotating galaxies</h3>
                                <p>Galaxies with uncommon properties are exceptionally interesting to study as these may provide key insights into the physics of galaxy evolution. One example of such are counterrotating galaxies. We find and analyze systems in the Illustris simulation where the stellar and gas disk rotate in the opposite sense, providing the first statistical prediction of the occurence and formation history of these galaxies. This work is particularly timely as observational IFU surveys such as CALIFA, MANGA, and SAMI measure stellar and gas kinematics for a large number of galaxies. We find that star-gas counterrotating low-mass galaxies have experienced significant episodes of gas removal in the past, either through strong feedback or gas stripping, and subsequently accreted gas with misaligned angular momentum. Therefore counterrotation may be more strongly correlated with the environment and properties of a galaxy at earlier times instead of those at the present-day.</br>(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...878..143S/abstract" target="_blank"><b>Starkenburg</b> et al. 2019</a>)</p>

                                <p>Within the LCDM cosmological framework dark matter halo mass function is almost completely scale-free. The formation of galaxies however is not scale-free. There should therefore be a large number of low-mass halos that have not been able to form stars or a galaxy within them, and that are thus not observable in light. These so-called dark halos can however have a strong gravitational effect, for example on low-mass structures like dwarf galaxies. In this series of papers we study the interaction of dwarf galaxies with their dark satellites. Such an interection can produce effects similar to major mergers for larger galaxies, creating large tidal arms and tails, and central or offset starbursts and long-term increases in star formation in the dwarf galaxy. Studying candidates of these mergers in the universe may provide an additional route to understanding the properties of dark matter.</br>(<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...758L...5H/abstract" target="_blank">Helmi, Sales, Starkenburg, <b>Starkenburg</b> et al. 2012</a>; </br><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...575A..59S/abstract" target="_blank"><b>Starkenburg</b> et al. 2015</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A..24S/abstract" target="_blank">2016a</a>; <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...595A..56S/abstract" target="_blank">2016b</a>)</p>
